Vulnerability Assessment Report
1st January 20XX

System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.
Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.
Purpose
Consider the following questions to help you write:
How is the database server valuable to the business?
Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?

Approach
This qualitative vulnerability assessment focuses on the greatest potential risks posed by an unsecured, publicly accessible database. The threats chosen represent a combination of external (malicious hackers, competitors) and internal (insider threats) actors, aligning with NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. These threats were selected because they target critical business data and services. Unauthorized access is highly likely due to the open configuration, and exfiltration or DoS attacks can severely disrupt operations. Insider threats, while less likely, still pose a tangible risk given the remote nature of the workforce and lack of granular access control.
Remediation Strategy
To remediate the risks identified, the company should implement layered security controls following a Defense in Depth strategy. First, apply the Principle of Least Privilege by enforcing strict Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) to ensure users access only the data they need. Second, replace SSL with TLS 1.2+ encryption for all connections and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect against unauthorized access. Implement an IP allow-list, restricting server access to specific corporate locations or VPN endpoints. Finally, deploy logging and auditing tools under the AAA framework to monitor access patterns and detect anomalies in real time. These measures will both reduce vulnerability and increase visibility into system access.
